# threejs-paraview-display

To use the display, I first navigate to the folder containing threeParaviewTest.html.

Next, I enter the command "python -m http.server" in Powershell.

Then I go to http://localhost:8000/ in my browser. Clicking on threeParaviewTest.html should bring you to the display.
